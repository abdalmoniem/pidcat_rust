📃 PidCat
🎯 Overview
PidCat is an enhanced Android logcat viewer originally created by Jake Wharton for the Android Open Source Project. This Windows-optimized fork adds modern features including VT100 color support, advanced tag filtering with substring matching, and improved column formatting.
PidCat filters logcat output by application package name, colorizes the output for better readability, and provides powerful filtering options to help you focus on the logs that matter.

🐛 Troubleshooting
Colors Not Showing on Windows
Problem: No colors appear in the output.
Solution:
Ensure you're on Windows 10/11
Run from Windows Terminal or PowerShell
Check that -n (no-color) flag is not set

ADB Not Found
Problem: adb: command not found or similar error.
Solution:
Add Android SDK platform-tools to your PATH
Or specify full path to adb in environment

No Logs Appearing
Problem: PidCat runs but shows no output.
Solution:
Verify your app is running: adb shell ps | grep your.package.name
Check package name is correct (case-sensitive)
Try with -a flag to see all logs
Ensure device is connected: adb devices

Tag Filter Not Working
Problem: Using -t but not seeing expected logs.
Solution:
Tags use substring matching by default
Check tag names in logcat: adb logcat -v brief
Tags are case-sensitive
Use --always-display-tags to verify which tags are shown
